    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! Nice to meet you, My name is Zaky. I'm a student trying to learn how to code and make websites, 
      but honestly currently I am on gap year and about to enter University this year hopefully. 
      Oh yeah I've been coding ever since I entered high school in 2021, I'm currently 18 and believe it or not, I'm from Indonesia!! (psst! I have 4 cats!)
    </p>

    <p>
      Although my experience in coding is pretty low, I still try to learn and get better every day. 
      My skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are somewhat self-taught! So I apologize if there's any bugs on my website. 
      Oh yeah, my skills are as listed below:
